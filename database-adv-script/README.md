#  ALX Airbnb Database Project: Advanced SQL & Performance Optimization

This project is part of the **ALX Backend Program – Airbnb Database Module**.  
It focuses on **advanced SQL techniques, database optimization, and performance tuning** using a simulated Airbnb platform schema.

---

## Project Objectives

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

-  Crafting **complex SQL queries** with joins, subqueries, and aggregations
- Enhancing performance using **EXPLAIN ANALYZE** and **indexing strategies**
-  Implementing **table partitioning** for scalable data management
-  Adopting a DBA mindset to make data-driven schema and query optimizations

## Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL**: Core database for query execution and optimization
- **SQL (Postgres dialect)**: For writing and refining complex queries
- **EXPLAIN ANALYZE**: For diagnosing and improving query performance

## Database Schema Overview

The database simulates an Airbnb-like platform with the following tables:

- `users`: Stores guest and host information
- `properties`: Contains rental listing details
- `bookings`: Tracks reservation records
- `payments`: Records transaction data
- `reviews`: Captures user ratings and feedback
- `messages`: Logs communication between users

## Performance Optimization Techniques

| Technique              | Description                                                  |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Joins & Subqueries** | Efficiently retrieve and filter data across multiple tables |
| **Window Functions**   | Enable advanced analytics like ranking and aggregations     |
| **Indexing**           | Accelerate `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY` operations       |
| **Query Refactoring**  | Optimize query logic to reduce execution time               |
| **Partitioning**       | Enhance performance for large `bookings` table using `start_date` partitions |
| **Monitoring**         | Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for continuous performance analysis   |

## Takeaways

- Strategic indexing and schema design significantly boost query performance
- Partitioning is critical for managing large, time-series datasets
- Writing efficient, maintainable SQL is as crucial as functional correctness
- Ongoing performance monitoring ensures long-term database efficiency
