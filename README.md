# Airbnb Relational Database Project

This project models the backend database schema of a simplified Airbnb-style property rental platform. It is designed to support core operations such as user registration, property listings, bookings, payments, reviews, and user messaging.


## Project Objectives

- Design a relational database for a property rental platform
- Apply normalization principles (up to 3NF)
- Create an ER diagram to visualize relationships
- Write SQL scripts to define and populate the database
- Enable realistic testing using sample and/or fake data

---

## Features & Entities

The schema supports:

-  **Users** (guests & hosts)
-  **Properties** (listed by hosts)
-  **Bookings** (reservations by guests)
-  **Payments** (for bookings)
-  **Reviews** (user feedback on properties)
-  **Messages** (between users)
